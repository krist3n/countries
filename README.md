# Countries Guessing Game

One day, I woke up and figured I should know the names of every country in the world. So I implemented a game in Python which prompts you to guess every country in a selected region (either world or by continent).

I used Python dictionaries.

Obviously not a super intensive project but still fun to put together. And I learned a lot more geography!
